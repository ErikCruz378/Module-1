Something I know is video games. 

I've been playing my entire life mostly for fun but I have also played competitively. 

I played 1 year of clash royale competitively and 2 years of overwatch. I even spent some time coaching other overwatch teams.

Other than that I like to learn about anything that interests me. Whenever I see something I like I always do some research on it to learn more.
