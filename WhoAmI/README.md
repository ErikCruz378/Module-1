Hello! My name is Erik Cruz. I'm 19, born in Derby, CT and now living in East Haven, CT.

My hobbies are gaming, streaming, watching anime, and reading manga.

I like cats, being alone, and sometimes going to the gym.

I have acrophobia and arachnophobia. I also have selective mutism so don't think im just ignoring you.
